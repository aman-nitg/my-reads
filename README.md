# MyReads Project

This project is a part of the React Nanodegree Course by Udacity.
It is a bookshelf app that allows you to select and categorize books you have read, are currently reading, or want to read.
You can also search for books and categorize them into different shelves from the search page itself.

## Installation and Running

Install all project dependencies with:

```js
npm install
```

Run the development server with:

```js
npm start
```

## Important

The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.
